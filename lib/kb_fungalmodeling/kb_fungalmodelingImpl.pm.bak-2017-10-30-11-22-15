The actual function is declared using 'funcdef' to specify the name
and input/return arguments to the function.  For all typical KBase
Apps that run in the Narrative, your function should have the
'authentication required' modifier.

=head1 TYPES



=head2 assembly_ref

=over 4



=item Description

A 'typedef' allows you to provide a more specific name for
a type.  Built-in primitive types include 'string', 'int',
'float'.  Here we define a type named assembly_ref to indicate
a string that should be set to a KBase ID reference to an
Assembly data object.

a string

=head2 FilterContigsParams

=over 4



=item Description

A 'typedef' can also be used to define compound or container
objects, like lists, maps, and structures.  The standard KBase
convention is to use structures, as shown here, to define the
input and output of your function.  Here the input is a
reference to the Assembly data object, a workspace to save
output, and a length threshold for filtering.

To define lists and maps, use a syntax similar to C++ templates
to indicate the type contained in the list or map.  For example:

    list <string> list_of_strings;
    mapping <string, int> map_of_ints;

=item Description

Here is the definition of the output of the function.  The output
can be used by other SDK modules which call your code, or the output
visualizations in the Narrative.  'report_name' and 'report_ref' are
special output fields- if defined, the Narrative can automatically
render your Report.
